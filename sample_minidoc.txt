Sample Minidoc in AsciiDoc
==========================
Wade Hampton <wadeh@localhost>
0.2.3, 4/6/2016: more examples added

Summary:
--------

The document starts with a Summary block describing the doc.
The document should be short, simple, and use a clean subset
of the AsciiDoc format.  If the document is a README.md for
GitHub, it may require further simplification.

This is a test document.  It is only a test.  Do not kick 
your cat or otherwise panic.  It is only a test.  No nuclear
radiation will impact your site.  This is {docname}.

Be sure to create a header like the above.  The full name with 
e-mail will allow a2x to create a clean document header.  Be sure 
to add the comma after the version number.

History:
--------

History is a short block with either N/A or a change log and it
follows the Summary block.  It should be indented by 2 spaces.
The lines should have version, date, optional initials, and changes.

  0.1.0	02/25/2016  created
  0.2.0 02/25/2016  Second version
  0.2.1 03/11/2016  Minor updates, more text added
  0.2.2 03/14/2016  more examples added
  0.2.3 04/06/2016  more examples added

Notes:
------

After History are document sections, for example this one is 
called Notes....

This is a sample minidoc.  It only includes 1 top-level section,
the section with the line of ==== at the top.  Each subsequent
section uses a line of dashes.  Bullets use * and numbered lists
use 1. etc.  Bold is * + text + * like *this is bold*.  Note, 
the old converter may convert any * to bold....

If text is to be pre-formatted, preceed with a blank line
then indent like:

  This should be pre-format text
  And this should be the second line
  1.   asdf -- preformat numbered list....
  2.   jkl;

*  Add spaces after bullets, before pre-format text.
*  Test with asciidoc inputdoc.txt, and test with a2x (see Makefile).
*  Numbered lists should use a "n.", not "n)".  

New Subsection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sub-section may be defined using "~~~~" under the title.  

New Item:: This is a labeled item w/o the displayed colon.

Labeled List::  A labeled list like this may be used with 
  text followed by two colons (a third is optional and 
  with some version is displayed).

New Item:: This is a labeled item

New Subsection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yet another sub-section!

New Section:
------------

* New section is here
* This is a second bullet

1. This is a numbered list
2. This is the second bullet.

    This is pre-format text after the bullet

3. This is another bullet in the list....

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.

[start=1]
1.  This is a new numbered list.
2.  And more list.
.   More.

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.

[start=1]
1.  This is item 1.

2.   Next item

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.  Below is a Roman number list (not supported
with older versions of AsciiDoc).

[start=1]
i) Roman level 1
ii) Roman next

This is a list with implicit numbering:

.  Item 1
.  Item 2
.  Item 3

Conversion:
-----------

* Basic to HTML (w/ asciidoc don't need -o OFILE):

  asciidoc -o sample_minidoc-1.html sample_minidoc.txt 

* Basic conversion with DocBook XSL Stylesheets which adds
  a revision history table and table of contents.  
  
  a2x sample_minidoc.txt       # creates TOC too!
  a2x -d article -f xhtml sample_minidoc.txt

* PDF and PS (need newer Asciidoc, not CentOS 5):

  a2x -d article -f pdf sample_minidoc.txt
  a2x -d article -f ps sample_minidoc.txt
