==========================
Wade Hampton <wadeh@localhost>
0.2.2, 3/14/2016: more examples added

This is a test document.  It is only a test.  Do not kick 
your cat or otherwise panic.  It is only a test.  No nuclear
radiation will impact your site.  This is {docname}.

Be sure to create a header like above.  The full name with e-mail
will allow a2x to create a clean document header.  Be sure 
to add the comma after the version number.

History:
--------

This is where history would go -- indent 2 spaces for preformat text.

  0.1.0	02/25/2016    created
  0.2.0 02/25/2016    Second version
  0.2.1 03/11/2016    Minor updates, more text added
  0.2.2 03/14/2016    more examples added

Notes:
------

This is a sample minidoc.  It only includes 1 top-level section,
the section with the line of ==== at the top.  Each subsequent
section uses a line of dashes.  Bullets use * and numbered lists
use 1) etc.  Bold is * + text + * like *this is bold*.  Note, 
the old convertor may convert any * to bold....

If text is to be pre-formatted, preceed with a blank line
then indent like:

  This should be pre-format text
  And this should be the second line
  1.   asdf -- preformat numbered list....
  2.   jkl;

*  Add spaces after bullets, before pre-format text.
*  Test with asciidoc inputdoc.txt, and test with a2x (see Makefile).
*  Numbered lists should use a "n.", not "n)".  

New Section:
------------

* New section is here
* This is a second bullet

1. This is a numbered list
2. This is the second bullet.

    This is pre-format text after the bullet

3. This is another bullet in the list....

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.

[start=1]
1.  This is a new numbered list.
2.  And more list.
.   More.

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.

[start=1]
1.  This is item 1.

2.   Next item

This is a paragraph after a bullet list. To restart the list use 
the [start=1] tag.  Below is a Roman number list (not supported
with older AsciiDoc).

[start=1]
i) Roman level 1
ii) Roman next

This is a list with implicit numbering:

.  Item 1
.  Item 2
.  Item 3

Conversion:
-----------

* Basic to HTML (w/ asciidoc don't need -o OFILE):

  asciidoc -o sample_minidoc-1.html sample_minidoc.txt 

* Basic conversion with DocBook XSL Stylesheets which adds
  a revision history table and table of contents.  
  
  a2x sample_minidoc.txt       # creates TOC too!
  a2x -d article -f xhtml sample_minidoc.txt

* PDF and PS (need newer Asciidoc, not CentOS 5):

  a2x -d article -f pdf sample_minidoc.txt
  a2x -d article -f ps sample_minidoc.txt
