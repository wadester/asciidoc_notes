0.2.0, 2/25/2016: Second version

This is a test document.  It is only a test.  Do not kick 
your cat or otherwise panic.  It is only a test.  No nuclear
radiation will imact your site.

History:
--------

This is where history would go -- indent 2 spaces for preformat text.

  0.1.0	02/25/2016    created
  0.2.0 02/25/2016    Second version

Notes:
------

This is a sample minidoc.  It only includes 1 top-level section,
the section with the line of ==== at the top.  Each subsequent
section uses a line of dashes.  Bullets use * and numbered lists
use 1) etc.  Bold is * + text + * like *this is bold*.

If text is to be pre-formatted, preceed with a blank line
then indent like:

  This should be pre-format text
  And this should be the second line
  1.   asdf
  2.   jkl;


New Section:
------------

* New section is here
* This is a second bullet

1) This is a numbered list
2) This is the second bullet.
